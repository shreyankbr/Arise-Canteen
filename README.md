## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Firebase account
- Web server (or run locally)
- Modern web browser

### Setup Instructions

1. **Firebase Configuration**:
   - Create a new Firebase project
   - Enable Email/Password authentication in Firebase Console
   - Update Firebase configuration in `script.js`:
     ```javascript
     const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
       databaseURL: "YOUR_DATABASE_URL",
       projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
       storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
       messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
       appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
     };
     ```

2. **Database Rules**:
   - Set up Firebase Realtime Database with appropriate security rules
   - Recommended structure:
     ```
     {
       "menu": {
         "item1": {
           "name": "Item Name",
           "price": 50,
           "category": "breakfast",
           "soldOut": false
         }
       },
       "orders": {
         "order1": {
           "studentId": "user123",
           "items": {
             "item1": {
               "name": "Item Name",
               "price": 50,
               "quantity": 2
             }
           },
           "status": "Pending",
           "createdAt": TIMESTAMP
         }
       },
       "users": {
         "user123": {
           "email": "user@college.edu",
           "type": "student",
           "createdAt": TIMESTAMP
         }
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Deployment**:
   - Upload all files to your web server
   - Ensure all file paths are correct
   - Test all user flows

## Security Considerations

- All passwords are securely hashed using Firebase Authentication
- Users can only access features appropriate for their role
- Admin functions require re-authentication for sensitive operations
- Database rules should be configured to prevent unauthorized access

## Limitations

- Currently supports only UPI payments
- No native mobile app (web-only)
- Limited to single canteen management
- No inventory tracking system

## Future Enhancements

- Add cash payment option
- Implement loyalty/rewards program
- Expand to multiple canteens/locations
- Add dietary filters (vegetarian, vegan, etc.)
- Include food ratings and reviews
- Push notifications for order updates
